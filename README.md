## Its an open-source messenger built on the Telegram Platform.

### Are they ads?
Just some Facebook-style sponsored ads at the posts sections. But we promise they won't annoy you.

### What will I benefit?

* Secure communication with friends and family.
* The speed and high storage capacity of the Telegram servers.
* Facebook-like posts.
* High level customizability.
* Increases contact when new friends are added from the platform.

### What does it have that WhatsApp doesn't?

### Is it on Google Playstore or Apple Appstore
We plan to put it there. But for now, its just a web app.

### Why make the switch?
